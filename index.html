<h1> About me</h1>
<p>My name is Amanullah kalhoro. I am 20 years old going on 21! :) <br>
  I love sports and love putting my mind to things, problem solving, puzzles and even trying to figure my way around life. Though still young, I feel my future is as bright as the morning sun.<br> if u disagree you're as dark as the night sky. Most of my life has been in Manchester though I was born abroad. I can speak 4 Languages including English(obv), Sindhi, urdu and jadgali.<br>
  I was born in Karachi - Pakistan. The general area I lived in was very dangerous and in 2005 England was blessed with my presence.<br>Over the years I have experimented with different subjects in my studies including uniformed public services, automotive mechanics, arts and design and lastly programming.
