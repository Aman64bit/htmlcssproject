     </ul>    <h1>unit 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business:</h1>

    <p>There are many purposes for the use of i.t in business, over the last 20 years technology has proved itself to be an invaluable tool to businesses and organisations. It has dramatically improved the way we do business and has made so many lives so much easier using for example tech platforms, in turn cutting down on costs and increasing profit. Digital marketing, cloud computing and digital communications are just some ways i.t has contributed to business. I.t has developed so much and now includes a wide array of useful tools to help any fledgling business or even the top dogs. Such tools include: Systematic management, Data analysis.</p>

    <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?:</h2>

    <p>Different projects require different tools, methods and skills. For web development, one could follow a simple method of conceptualising, planning, development and testing. When conceptualising you have to initially think of the  possibilities, risks and challenges which may incur with the project. Also at this point certain key parameters are declared such as costs and time requirement. This is then reviewed and approved before moving on to the next stage.</p>
    
    <h3>Planning:</h3>
 
    <p>At this point a detailed plan is made to materialise the concept/idea.
        Design and development teams work with user experience and marketing to create requirements such as : design, initial user experience.</p>

    <h3>Development and testing:</h3>
   
    <p>The development process begins to turn the concept into reality, starting naturally with the back end. This is to create the architecture on which the front end will rely. A beta version is made to review and adjust.</p>
   
    <h3>Deployment:</h3>
   
    <p>This is a crucial step, upto this point the product has been tested and everything must be ready, this includes all the backend working properly and front end fully functional and upto quality standards, then finally it is deployed.</p>
  
    <h3>Tools and skills:</h3>
   
    <p>There are many options available to a developer to use. Some of the most popular are js, css, c#, html. These programming languages are a key tool and require the right skills, front end development would make use of css, html. While back end use would require the right tools such as python.</p>
   

    <h2> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
  
    <p>To start off I will make a <a href="https://trello.com/b/1N7ITzut/web-research" target="_blank">Trello board</a> use my brainstorming notes to decide on and configure tasks for my project. After a general plan to work towards I research and prepare my website content i.e information(paragraphs), images. Make a folder for my project and gather everything needed there including the base index page file. Write a basic html code to start on and adjust it into a rough mockup.  Designing the site, using my mock up, Insert my content i.e paragraphs, images. Then adjusting the code and linking web pages, creating a navigation bar etc. Proof read the code check for any mistakes and review the design, make sure it's up to standards. Test the site, making sure there are no dead links and code errors.</p>

    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
  
    <p>There are many risks associated when working on a digital project, some of them include:
  
    <h3>Lack of diversity in expertise:</h3>
   
    <p>having a team of digital programmers for a project but missing a business oriented team member to have some business expertise to act as bridge to manage customer needs to the back-end operations.</p>
  
    <h3>Strained digital strategy:</h3>
   
    <p>A company needs to have a well defined digital strategy and set what their overall goal is. This can help the project stay on focus rather than prioritizing one department's initiative above others. A real and very personal example is Microsoft getting hung up on the kinect when releasing the Xbox one, focusing efforts on motion detection, night vision and other features rather than focusing on game performance. being a larger box than the Ps4 (its main competition) and still requiring a large external power brick led to some damage towards the companies reputation as well as sales.</p>
  
    <h3>Overambition:</h3>
  
    <p>Many times companies get hung up on creating a perfect product. This often leads to the project being dragged on and on past deadlines, it is helpful to use the idea of “minimum viable product” or realising a beta version and improving on that.</p>
  
    <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
  
    <p>Adding new technology or even updating your old tech can be very beneficial but choosing the right kind of tech is key. To start one would have to analyze the current tech in use, see what is good and what needs improving. It can be hard for a business to update when they’ve been using old tech or strategies.  A company needs to think a lot about where their business is headed and choose tech accordingly, this can mean updating to tech that grows with your company and with time. On the other hand choosing tech that is or quickly becoming outdated, can mean wasted money and resources. Also a business needs to think in terms of what is needed and choosing tech that will be useful rather than it being  another tool in the box and rarely used.</p>
   
    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
   
    <p>For my project, I used Trello to plan and track my work progress. With the nature of tech projects it is useful to keep track and make sense of what is happening, what is done and what is left to do in the project at any given time. Dividing my work into tasks and setting them as tabs on Trello makes it easy to understand, using this method I set up my trello board, I set up my tasks and adjusted as the project went along. I have worked in visual studios for my coding and testing, it is a useful tool which supports a range of programing language and has tons of useful features which make working easier and faster. In collaboration with Trello I used Slack which was very easy to understand and use, allowed for easy file sharing and easy communication between the team. Github allows for easy setup as it can allow you to choose the right version of the code you plan to program.</p>
  
    <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
 
    <p>When working on digital projects one must plan and prepare for all the legal rules and regulations which may be in place. These laws and regulations are set in place to protect consumers rights such as full declaration of what information we store about them and what we do with that information. This may include emails, cookies, trackers, preferences, social media posts. On the 25th of may 2018, the GDPR (general data protection regulation) was implemented as law in the european union. This impacts how businesses and big tech companies collect and process information of eu citizens. The GDPR regulations dictate that consumers have:
        “The right to be informed, right of access, right to rectification, right to erasure/to be forgotten, right to restrict processing, right to data portability, right to object and rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.” <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/staff/announcements/gpdr-understanding-the-rights-of-individuals" target="_blank">University of leicester</a> </p>
