    <h2>2.1 review the ongoing use of it tool and change approach as needed in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? e.g. visual studio code, trello.</h2>
   
    <p>I used a variety of i.t tools for my project. Firstly because I am comfortable with microsoft os, so given the choice between mac os or windows I would pick windows, I find it much more comfortable because of prior experience.<br>
    Visual studio code: I used visual studio code and I found it to be very easy to understand and use. It allows for complex coding with a variety of different languages as well as being simple to use with user friendly features such as auto suggestions. I also found the layout and form of visual studio code to be quite user friendly, helping me learn and experiment.<br>
   
    <br>Trello: I used Trello to track my work and review my tasks. I found Trello to be very simple and easy to understand. It allows for easy tracking of tasks using the kanban method. Putting my tasks into to do, doing and done tabs with short descriptions helped me be more productive as I wasnâ€™t wasting time doing two things at once.</p>
   
    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h2>
  
    <p>For my web project I used visual studio code and I think it is very appropriate as it can be very easy and simple to write code and edit it to your liking with it. It is a very powerful and diverse tool which can be used with different complexity of code allowing for simple projects and complex projects while staying very simple and easy to understand. To keep track of my project I used Trello, I think this was the right choice as being a beginner I found it to be super useful and helping me to focus on specific tasks I set out for myself, it can help to keep track of what's happening and when, with this knowledge I was able to set my time to certain tasks with more priority. </p>
 
   
    <h2>2.3 Assess the strength and weaknesses of your final project - are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interest of openness. What would you change?</h2>
  
   
    <p>My website is very informative which I like as I feel the text and layout is easy to read and understand, I like the fact my website has a navigation bar, it's very helpful as it can be confusing keeping when scrolling from page to page. I liked using pictures and colours for making a general good vibe and feel. Some of my weaknesses were that I needed more time to complete parts of the website further, this includes touching up css and having a bit more styling and some more complexity.</p>
   
   
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
   
   
    <p>There are alot of things I wish I could improve on my website, such as having a nicer and further developed layout for my pages to make it more appealing to the eye as well as making it easier to navigate. I feel that with more time I could optimize my web pages and have them include more features, smoother graphics and more links to other webpages.</p>
  
  
    <h2> 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
  
  
    <p>Select and use appropriate development techniques for clarity and good navigation. I used a number of techniques to make sure my webpages were simple to understand and maneuver  through. I used: tag-names. I used clear descriptive tag names to make sure my work was clear and easily manageable if ever I were to go back and edit things. Also I used alt tags and labeled them descriptively to make sure any users with visual impairment would be able to understand what is there. I also kept things as simple as I could when developing my website as it can help allow for easier understanding and navigation through the code. I also put page up and page down links to further make it easy for users to navigate.</p>
