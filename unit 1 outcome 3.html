    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
    
    
    <p>When using trello and slack i found there were a lot of benefits, one of these is being able to clearly manage your tabs on trello and label them descriptively as well as colour coding your tabs to be able to look over them at a glance and know what is what. Also trello is a board which allows for team work with great efficiency as it can break down tasks and assign different group members to different tasks enabling the team to work on multiple tasks at once while still following the kanban method to keep things in order. However trello does have some disadvantages such as having so many tasks that when certain elements change suddenly(often happens in projects) one would have to keep going back and keep changing tasks which can be a bit tedious when you have so many, as well as moving them over from different parts of the board. Sometimes I found myself moving onto the next task and finishing it before i would realise to edit the tasks or move them from to do, doing and done. This is partly because of how some tasks link with others which allows for more efficiently tweaking things between two tasks rather than having to go back and change things on the board every time. Slack is great for file sharing and having different channels for different groups, it also allows for instant file sharing and messaging which can be a benefit but also sometimes a bit confusing when having to look through so many messages to be able to find a specific file.</p>
   
     <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
   
   
     <p>After some time working on my project I feel storing the right files in the right places with clear names and organised folders can really help improve efficiency and productivity. To help me make the most of my time I would also lay out a plan on how the project will go from start to finish and try to set dates and times for specific tasks. This helps me prevent confusion. Also I feel a working pattern of hard work with short rewarding breaks can help improve concentration when working, it improves the quality of work as well as helping you not get distracted.</p>
  
  
    <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using i.t. In digital projects, what would you do differently next time?</h2>
  
  
    <p>To help improve efficiency i would use trello and slack better, learning from my project i would next time use trello and try to manage things in a much calmer and straightforward manner, using trello can be helpful but to avoid any holdack with too many tasks i would limit the number of tasks im doing at any one time and focus on them, also i would prioritise key aspects of my project first, in combination with this i would also use slack, there were files shared with vague or inaccurate names which caused a lot of time to be wasted trying to figure them out. To prevent this next time i'll try to be much more organised in my approach when coding and sharing files between team members, making sure every file name is descriptive.</p>

    <h2>3.4 describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>

    <p>User testing is very important as testing can show mistakes which can have bigger consequences down the line. Big tech companies make sure everything in their webpages are tested and tried to ensure all code is being represented as designed. User testing can not only help test but help build a website as flaws can be found and fixed but suggestions could also be made to improve the website in further ways may that be in terms of visuals and also functionality. Also security is very important to websites, testing can ensure that all aspects of a webpage are complete. Testing is essential to the development of digital projects may that be a website or anything else.</p>
