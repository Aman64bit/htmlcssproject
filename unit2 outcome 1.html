        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
        <p>My website consists of a homepage with my about me, then other pages that represent each outcome and the questions I was required to answer.</p>
        <p>I used simple text with headings and paragraphs with my nav bar on the right hand side. I also made sure my nav bar was visible on every page so you can move anywhere at anytime. I also tried to make text clear and pushed text up on the page as to make it easier for people to use. Especially for users with disabilities. I used a nice and simple font that's clear to understand, </p>

     <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
   
   
     <p>There are many different types of disabilities, the definition of disability can vary from country to country and even different communities of people within those countries. A user can have one or more types of disabilities such as having little to no vision, impared hearing, amputees. Web developers have to cater to these disabilities. They can do this in a number of ways. 

        Alt tags: alt tags can contain useful information which can be read by screen readers  for people with impared vision. The alt tag should contain a description of the content, image, text ect. So if the user hovers over the an image of a fast car,
        The reader should read out a description like a speeding car. 
        
        Subtitles and transcripts: When having a video on your page, there should be descriptive subtitles or a transcript for users with a lack of hearing.
